## Abstract

The neural mechanisms underlying memory regulation during sleep are not yet fully understood. We found that rapid eye
movement (REM) sleep-active melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH)-producing neurons in the hypothalamus actively
contribute to forgetting. Hypothalamic MCH neurons densely innervated the dorsal hippocampus. Activation or inhibition
of MCH neurons impaired or improved hippocampus-dependent memory, respectively. Activation of MCH nerve terminals in
vitro reduced firing of hippocampal pyramidal neurons by increasing inhibitory inputs. Wake- and REM sleep-active MCH
neurons were distinct populations that were randomly distributed in the hypothalamus. REM sleep state-dependent
inhibition of MCH neurons impaired hippocampus-dependent memory without affecting sleep architecture or quality. REM
sleep-active MCH neurons in the hypothalamus are thus involved in active forgetting in the hippocampus.
