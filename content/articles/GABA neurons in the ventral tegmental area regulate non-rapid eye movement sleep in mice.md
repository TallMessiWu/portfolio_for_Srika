## Abstract

Sleep/wakefulness cycle is regulated by coordinated interactions between sleep- and wakefulness-regulating neural
circuitry. However, the detailed mechanism is far from understood. Here, we found that glutamic acid decarboxylase
67-positive GABAergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTAGad67+) are a key regulator of non-rapid eye movement (
NREM) sleep in mice. VTAGad67+ project to multiple brain areas implicated in sleep/wakefulness regulation such as the
lateral hypothalamus (LH). Chemogenetic activation of VTAGad67+ promoted NREM sleep with higher delta power whereas
optogenetic inhibition of these induced prompt arousal from NREM sleep, even under highly somnolescent conditions, but
not from REM sleep. VTAGad67+ showed the highest activity in NREM sleep and the lowest activity in REM sleep. Moreover,
VTAGad67+ directly innervated and inhibited wake-promoting orexin/hypocretin neurons by releasing GABA. As such,
optogenetic activation of VTAGad67+ terminals in the LH promoted NREM sleep. Taken together, we revealed that VTAGad67+
play an important role in the regulation of NREM sleep.
