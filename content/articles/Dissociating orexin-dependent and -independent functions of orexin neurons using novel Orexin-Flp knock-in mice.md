## Abstract

Uninterrupted arousal is important for survival during threatening situations. Activation of orexin/hypocretin neurons
is implicated in sustained arousal. However, orexin neurons produce and release orexin as well as several
co-transmitters including dynorphin and glutamate. To disambiguate orexin-dependent and -independent physiological
functions of orexin neurons, we generated a novel Orexin-flippase (Flp) knock-in mouse line. Crossing with Flp-reporter
or Cre-expressing mice showed gene expression exclusively in orexin neurons. Histological studies confirmed that orexin
was knock-out in homozygous mice. Orexin neurons without orexin showed altered electrophysiological properties, as well
as received decreased glutamatergic inputs. Selective chemogenetic activation revealed that both orexin and
co-transmitters functioned to increase wakefulness, however, orexin was indispensable to promote sustained arousal.
Surprisingly, such activation increased the total time spent in cataplexy. Taken together, orexin is essential to
maintain basic membrane properties and input-output computation of orexin neurons, as well as to exert awake-sustaining
aptitude of orexin neurons.
